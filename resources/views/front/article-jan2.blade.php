    <p class="uk-article-meta">Written by <a href="#">Jamborow</a> on 22 January 2022. 
    <p class="uk-text-break"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Coronavirus pandemic persists, the volume and value of digital payment has significantly accelerated due to the need to maintain seamless payments while keeping contact limited.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="uk-text-break"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic set off a revolution in the payment industry, with businesses and stakeholders coming up with innovative digital payment options to help manage the impact of the pandemic.</span></p>
<p class="uk-text-break"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The year 2022 will magnify a good number of the innovations that the industry has yielded and here are some of the payment trends to watch out for this year.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="uk-text-break"><br /><br /></p>
<p class="uk-text-break"><strong>QR Codes </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- QR stands for Quick Response, it is</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a type of matrix barcode and as the name implies, it is used to facilitate quick transactions. It enjoyed tremendous popularity in 2021 as scanning to pay became an easy and contactless option for many.&nbsp; The </span><a href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2021/12/06/how-will-you-buy-goods-in-2022-payment-trends-shaping-the-future-of-commerce"><span style="font-weight: 400;">QR codes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allow for instant payments simply by scanning on your phone, which means whether you&rsquo;re scrolling social media or browsing your favourite online store &ndash; virtual payments have never been faster.</span></p>
<p class="uk-text-break"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is used in real life to pay at stores, restaurants and other establishments. It is predicted to gain more ground in 2022 as it doesn&rsquo;t just allow payment but also provides more information about the purchase.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="uk-text-break"><br /><br /></p>
<p class="uk-text-break"><strong>BNPL </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><strong>Buy Now Pay Later- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is one of the biggest payment trends we&rsquo;ve seen in recent years. It is an installment financing&nbsp; method that has rapidly been embraced and is favored to continue a widespread adoption in 2022. It gives users the option to make decisions at checkout.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="uk-text-break"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BNPL allows consumers to spread out payments over a defined period of time. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We at Jamborow understand how important this method of payment is to retailers and how it can help uplift the grassroots. BNPL in addition to microloan amongst others is part of the services we provide.</span></p>
<p class="uk-text-break"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also have a good system that allows consumers to spend responsibly using this method and create a great credit footprint.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="uk-text-break">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="uk-text-break"><strong>Cryptocurrency</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - With more apps&nbsp; having crypto payment as an option, we are more likely to see more transactions and payments made with cryptocurrency in 2022. The crypto industry exploded in 2021&nbsp; particularly through individuals and institutions investing in digital tokens, but it was not able to go mainstream as a means of payment at the time. However, things are currently looking up for the digital currency as it is now seen as a viable payment that can cross borders with little&nbsp; interest&nbsp; charge on completing a transaction. Cryptopay is part of the products we have on the </span><a href="https://jamborow.co.uk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jamborow platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, our users will enjoy seamless payment using this feature and will get ahead in the crypto world.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="uk-text-break">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="uk-text-break"><strong>Cash</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Yes, we are going digital and the virtual world is taking center stage, but we are not yet wiping out physical currencies. Cash is still going to be a major payment means even in 2022. In November 2021 </span><a href="http://pymnts.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PYMNTS.COM</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> survey showed that even with the rise in alternative payment methods, cash still remained at the 3rd most used payment means, just above Apple pay and Paypal.</span></p>
<p class="uk-text-break">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="uk-text-break"><strong>Super Apps</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Apps that act as a one-stop shop are known as super apps.&nbsp; We are looking forward to seeing more of those in 2022. Just like the Jamborow platform that brings several financial solutions under one umbrella, Super apps bring together both lifestyle and financial service functions, granting access and the ability to pay for many things people buy, with ease. Super apps can be formed&nbsp; through embedded payment or partnership strategy. From Amazon to PayPal, Revolut or Block, are all looking to launch a </span><a href="https://thefinancialbrand.com/126573/7-major-payment-trends-that-will-shake-up-banking-in-2022/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">super app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2022.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="uk-text-break">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="uk-text-break"><strong>P2P, B2B, B2C </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Peer to Peer, Business to Business and Business to Customer payments models have been around for a while but they will become more popular in 2022. They are now seen to be an easy way to transact and the absence of 3rd parties makes it more appealing to users. P2P payment is already largely used in cryptocurrency.</span></p>
<p class="uk-text-break"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Binance crypto platform is one of the popular ones that allows easy facilitation using this method. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merchants around the world are increasingly adopting real-time payments (RTP), their efficiency enables sellers, buyers and individuals to send and receive money in seconds. The driving force behind real-time payments is the tremendous changes taking place in RTP systems and are rooted in the proliferation of smartphones and P2P apps.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="uk-text-break">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="uk-text-break"><strong>E-wallets and Mobile Payment</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - 2022 will see a drastic adoption of </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/2022-altering-future-payments-apurvaa-gaikwad/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mobile payments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like Samsung Pay, Google Pay, our payment partner Jambopay and Apple Pay by integrating various payment providers that would support various equipment and systems for facilitating mobile payments. Businesses will partner with fintech companies to get access to payment platforms that will serve their customers, by doing so they would be providing an opportunity for customers to communicate directly with the business. E- wallets will also be more relevant in 2022, they are easy to use and that is exactly what modern businesses and consumers are looking to use.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="uk-text-break"><br /><br /></p>
<p class="uk-text-break"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quoting the renowned financial writer, Apurvaa Gaikwad, &ldquo;The payment ecosystem is one of the most technologically influential sectors in this pandemic. Innovation is not only highly driven with the changing face of the current payment system, but also, making it faster than the current pace.&rdquo; 2022 is going to be an exciting time in the payment industry, with the level of competition between the banks and fintech and the unending flow of innovation from the sector, all major players and consumers are looking with keen interest as the year unrolls. </span></p></article>
